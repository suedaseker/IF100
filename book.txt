"That exactly way I wanted it! Do think this sheep will have to have a great deal 
grass?" 
After a reflective silence answered: "The thing so good about box have given 
me at night can use it as his house." 
"That so. if are good I will give a string, too, so can tie him during day, 
and a post to tie him to." 
But little prince seemed shocked by this offer: "Tie him! What a queer idea!" 
"But if dont tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, get lost." 
My friend broke into another peal laughter: "But where do think would go?" 
"Anywhere. Straight ahead him." 
Then little prince said, earnestly: "That doesnt matter. Where I live, everything so small!" 
And, with perhaps a hint sadness, added: "Straight ahead him, nobody can go very far..." 
I had thus learned a second fact great importance: this was planet little prince 
came from was scarcely any larger than a house! But did not really surprise me much. I knew 
very well in addition to great planets, such as Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which 
we have given names, there are also hundreds others, some which are so small one has 
a hard time seeing them through telescope. 
When an astronomer discovers one these does not give it a name, but only a number. 
might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325." 
I have serious reason to believe planet from which little prince came asteroid 
known as B 612. This asteroid has only once been seen through telescope. was by a 
Turkish astronomer, in 1909. 
On making his discovery, astronomer had presented it to International Astronomical 
Congress, in a great demonstration. But was in Turkish costume, so nobody would believe 
what said. Grown ups are like that... 
Fortunately, however, for reputation Asteroid B 612, a Turkish dictator made a law his 
subjects, under pain death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 astronomer 
gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style elegance. this time 
everybody accepted his report. 
If I have told these details about asteroid, made a note its number for you, it on 
account grown ups their ways. When tell them have made a new friend, 
they never ask any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his 
voice sound like? What games does love best? Does collect butterflies?" Instead, they 
demand: "How old he? How many brothers has he? How much does weigh? How much 
money does his father make?" 
Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. 
If were to say to grown ups: "I saw a beautiful house made rosy brick, with geraniums 
in windows doves on roof," they would not be able to get any idea house at all. 
You would have to say to them: "I saw a house cost 20000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, 
what a pretty house is!" Just so, might say to them: "The proof little prince 
existed was charming, laughed, was looking for a sheep. If anybody 
wants a sheep, a proof exists." what good would it do to tell them that? They 
would shrug their shoulders, treat like a child. But if said to them: "The planet 
came from Asteroid B 612," then they would be convinced, leave in peace from their 
questions. They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show 
great forbearance toward grown up people. But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a 
matter indifference. 
I should have liked to begin this story in fashion fairy tales. I should have like to say: 
"Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet was scarcely any bigger 
than himself, who had need a sheep..." 
To those who understand life, would have given a much greater air truth to my story. Fori 
do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down 
these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his 
sheep. If I try to describe him here, it to make sure I shall not forget him. To forget a friend 
is sad. Not every one has had a friend. if I forget him, I may become like grown ups who 
are no longer interested in anything but figures... It for purpose, again, I have bought a 
box paints some pencils. 
It hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those 
of boa constrictor from outside boa constrictor from inside, since I was six. I 
shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure 
success. One drawing goes along all right, another has no resemblance to its subject. I make 
some errors, too, in little princes height: in one place too tall in another too short. 
And I feel some doubts about colour his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, 
now bad, I hope generally fair to middling. In certain more important details I shall make 
mistakes, also. But something will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything 
to me. thought, perhaps, I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep 
through walls boxes. Perhaps I am a little like grown ups. I have had to grow old. 
As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about little princes planet, his 
departure from it, his journey. information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall 
from his thoughts. It was in this way I heard, on third day, about catastrophe 
baobabs. 
This time, once more, I had sheep to thank for it. For little prince asked me abruptly, as if 
seized by a grave doubt, 
"It true, isnt it, sheep eat little bushes?" 
"Yes, true." 
"Ah! I am glad!" 
I did not understand why it was so important sheep should eat little bushes. But little 
prince added: "Then it follows they also eat baobabs?" I pointed out to little prince 
baobabs were not little bushes, but, on contrary, trees as big as castles; even if 
took a whole herd elephant away with him, herd would not eat up one single baobab. 
The idea herd elephant made little prince laugh. "We would have to put them one on 
top other," said. But made a wise comment: 
"Before they grow so big, baobabs start out by being little." 
At first seemed to be very much surprised. then laughed to yourself. said to me: 
"I am always thinking I am at home!" 
Just so. Everybody knows when it noon in United States sun setting over France. 
If could fly to France in one minute, could go straight into sunset, right from noon. 
Unfortunately, France too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all 
need do move your chair a few steps. can see day end twilight falling whenever 
you like... 
"One day," said to me, "I saw sunset forty four times!" 
And a little later added: "You know, one loves sunset, when one so sad..." "Were so 
sad, then?" I asked, "on day forty four sunsets?" 
But little prince made no reply. 
On fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to sheep, secret little princes life 
was revealed to me. 
Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, as if question had been born long silent 
meditation on his problem, demanded: "A sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, 
too?" 
"A sheep," I answered, "eats anything it finds in its reach." 
"Even flowers have thorns?" 
"Yes, even flowers have thorns." 
"Then thorns, what use are they?" I did not know. 
At moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt had got stuck in my engine. I was 
very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me breakdown my plane was 
extremely serious. I had so little drinking water left I had to fear for worst. 
"The thorns, what use are they?" 
The little prince never let go a question, once had asked it. As for me, I was upset over 
bolt. I answered with first thing came into my head: "The thorns are no use at all. 
Flowers have thorns just for spite!" 
"Oh!" There was a moment complete silence. 
Then little prince flashed back at me, with a kind resentfulness: "I dont believe you! 
Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure themselves as best they can. They 
believe their thorns are terrible weapons..." 
I did not answer. At instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still wont turn, I am going to 
knock it out with hammer." 
Again little prince disturbed my thoughts. "And actually believe flowers..." 
"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no no! I dont believe anything. I answered with first thing 
came into my head. Dont see, I am very busy with matters consequence!" 
I, myself, one flower which unique in world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but 
which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what 
doing, Oh! think not important! His face turned from white to red as continued: "If 
some one loves a flower, which just one single blossom grows in all millions millions 
stars, it enough to make him happy just to look at stars. 
He can say to himself, Somewhere, my flower there... But if sheep eats flower, in one 
moment all his stars will be darkened... think not important!" 
I soon learned to know this flower better. On little princes planet flowers had always been 
very simple. They had only one ring petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to 
nobody. One morning they would appear in grass, by night they would have faded 
peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come 
up; little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any 
other small sprouts on his planet. 
It might, see, have been a new kind baobab. shrub soon stopped growing, began to 
get ready to produce a flower. little prince, who was present at first appearance a huge 
bud, felt at once some sort miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But flower was 
not satisfied to complete preparations for her beauty in shelter her green chamber. She 
chose her colours with greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to 
go out into world all rumpled, like field poppies. It was only in full radiance her 
beauty she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! her mysterious 
adornment lasted for days days. Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed 
herself. And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned said: "Ah! I am 
scarcely awake. I beg will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..." But little 
prince could not restrain his admiration: 
"Oh! How beautiful are!" 
"Am I not?" flower responded, sweetly. "And I was born at same moment as sun..." 
The little prince could guess easily enough she was not any too modest, but how moving, 
exciting she was! 
"I think it time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If would have kindness to 
think my needs" little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can 
fresh water. 
"They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination." 
Such power was a thing for little prince to marvel at. If had been master such complete 
authority, would have been able to watch sunset, not forty four times in one day, but 
seventy two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his 
chair. because felt a bit sad as remembered his little planet, which had forsaken, 
plucked up his courage to ask king a favour: 
"I should like to see a sunset... do me kindness... Order sun to set..." 
"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic 
drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, if general did not carry out order 
had received, which one us would be in wrong?" king demanded. "The general, or 
myself?" 
"You," said little prince firmly. 
"Exactly. One much require from each one duty which each one can perform," king went 
on. "Accepted authority rests first all on reason. If ordered your people to go throw 
themselves into sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have right to require obedience 
because my orders are reasonable." 
"Then my sunset?" little prince reminded him: for never forgot a question once had 
asked it. 
"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science government, I 
shall wait until conditions are favourable." 
"When will be?" inquired little prince. "Hum! Hum!" replied king; before saying 
anything else consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! will be about... about... will be 
this evening about twenty minutes to eight. will see how well I am obeyed." 
The little prince yawned. was regretting his lost sunset. then, too, was already 
beginning to be a little bored. "I have nothing more to do here," said to king. "So I shall set 
out on my way again." "Do not go," said king, who was very proud having a subject. "Do 
not go. I will make a Minister!" "Minister what?" "Minster of... Justice!" "But there 
nobody here to judge!" "We do not know that," king said to him. "I have not yet made a 
complete tour my kingdom. I am very old. There no room here for a carriage. it tires me 
to walk." "Oh, but I have looked already!" said little prince, turning around to give one more 
glance to other side planet. 
On side, as on this, there was nobody at all... "Then shall judge yourself," king 
answered, "that most difficult thing all. It much more difficult to j udge oneself than to 
j udge others. If succeed in j udging yourself rightly, then are indeed a man true 
wisdom." 
"Yes," said little prince, "but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet. 
"Hum! Hum!" said king. "I have good reason to believe somewhere on my planet there 
an old rat. I hear him at night. can judge this old rat. From time to time will condemn him 
to death. Thus his life will depend on your j ustice. But will pardon him on each occasion; for 
he must be treated thriftily. only one we have." 
"I," replied little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death. now I think I will go on 
my way."  I 
dont amuse myself with balderdash. Two five make seven..." 
"Five hundred one million what?" repeated little prince, who never in his life had let go 
a question once had asked it. 
The businessman raised his head. "During fifty four years I have inhabited this planet, I 
have been disturbed only three times. first time was twenty two years ago, when some giddy 
goose fell from goodness knows where. made most frightful noise resounded all over 
the place, I made four mistakes in my addition. second time, eleven years ago, I was 
disturbed by an attack rheumatism. I dont get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. 
third time, well, this it! I was saying, then, five hundred one millions" 
"Millions what?" businessman suddenly realised there was no hope being left in 
peace until answered this question. 
"Millions those little objects," said, "which one sometimes sees in sky." "Flies?" "Oh, 
no. Little glittering objects." "Bees?" "Oh, no. Little golden objects set lazy men to idle 
dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters consequence. There no time for idle 
dreaming in my life." "Ah! mean stars?" "Yes, thats it. stars." "And what do do 
with five hundred millions stars?" "Five hundred one million, six hundred twenty two 
thousand, seven hundred thirty one. I am concerned with matters consequence: I am 
accurate." 
"And what do do with these stars?" "What do I do with them?" "Yes." "Nothing. I own them." 
"You own stars?" "Yes." "But I have already seen a king who..." "Kings do not own, they 
reign over. It a very different matter." 
"And what good does it do to own stars?" "It does me good making me rich." 
"And what good does it do to be rich?" 
"It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered." 
"This man," little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..." Nevertheless, 
he still had some more questions. "How it possible for one to own stars?" "To whom do they 
belong?" businessman retorted, peevishly. "I dont know. To nobody." "Then they belong to 
me, because I was first person to think it." "Is all necessary?" "Certainly. 
When find a diamond belongs to nobody, it yours. When discover an island 
belongs to nobody, it yours. When get an idea before any one else, take out a patent on 
it: it yours.  
"Then planet now makes a complete turn every minute, I no longer have a single second 
for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp put it out!" 
"That very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where live!" 
"It not funny at all!" said lamplighter. "While we have been talking together a month has 
gone by." 
"A month?" 
"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening." lighted his lamp again. As 
little prince watched him, felt loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. 
He remembered sunsets, which himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling 
up his chair; wanted to help his friend. 
"You know," said, "I can tell a way can rest whenever want to..." 
"I always want to rest," said lamplighter. For it possible for a man to be faithful lazy at 
the same time. 
The little prince went on with his explanation: "Your planet so small three strides will take 
you all way around it. To be always in sunshine, need only walk along rather slowly. 
When want to rest, will walk day will last as long as like." 
"That doesnt do me much good," said lamplighter. "The one thing I love in life to sleep." 
"Then youre unlucky," said little prince. 
"I am unlucky," said lamplighter. "Good morning." put out his lamp. 
"That man," said little prince to himself, as continued farther on his journey, "that man 
would be scorned by all others: by king, by conceited man, by tippler, by 
businessman. Nevertheless only one them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. 
Perhaps because thinking something else besides himself." 
He breathed a sigh regret, said to himself, again: "That man only one them all 
whom I could have made my friend. But his planet indeed too small. There no room on it for 
two people..." What little prince did not dare confess was was sorry most all to leave 
this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets! 
The sixth planet was ten times larger than last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who 
wrote voluminous books. 
"Oh, look! Here an explorer!" exclaimed to himself when saw little prince coming. 
The little prince sat down on table panted a little. had already travelled so much 
so far! 
"Where do come from?" old gentleman said to him. 
"What big book?" said little prince. "What are doing?" 
"I am a geographer," old gentleman said to him. 
"What a geographer?" asked little prince. "A geographer a scholar who knows 
location all seas, rivers, towns, mountains, deserts." 
"That very interesting," said little prince. "Here at last a man who has a real profession!" 
And cast a look around him at planet geographer. 
It was most magnificent stately planet had ever seen. 
"Your planet very beautiful," said. "Has it any oceans?" 
"I couldnt tell you," said geographer. 
"Ah!" little prince was disappointed. "Has it any mountains?" 
"I couldnt tell you," said geographer. 
"And towns, rivers, deserts?" 
"I couldnt tell that, either." 
"But are a geographer!" 
"Exactly," geographer said. "But I am not an explorer. I havent a single explorer on my 
planet. It not geographer who goes out to count towns, rivers, mountains, 
seas, oceans, deserts. geographer much too important to go loafing about. 
does not leave his desk. But receives explorers in his study. asks them questions, 
he notes down what they recall their travels. if recollections any one among them 
seem interesting to him, geographer orders an inquiry into explorers moral character." 
"Why that?" 
"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on books geographer. So would 
an explorer who drank too much." 
"Why that?" asked little prince. 
"Because intoxicated men see double. Then geographer would note down two mountains in a 
place where there was only one." 
"I know some one," said little prince, "who would make a bad explorer." 
"That possible. Then, when moral character explorer shown to be good, an inquiry 
is ordered into his discovery." 
"One goes to see it?" 
"No. would be too complicated. But one requires explorer to furnish proofs. For example, 
if discovery in question a large mountain, one requires large stones be brought 
back from it." geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement. "But come from far away! 
You are an explorer! shall describe your planet to me!" And, having opened his big register, 
the geographer sharpened his pencil. recitals explorers are put down first in pencil. One 
waits until explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink. "Well?" said 
geographer expectantly. 
"Oh, where I live," said little prince, "it not very interesting. It all so small. I have three 
volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active other extinct. But one never knows." 
"One never knows," said geographer. 
"I have also a flower." 
"We do not record flowers," said geographer. 
"Why that? flower most beautiful thing on my planet!" 
"We do not record them," said geographer, "because they are ephemeral." 
"What does mean ephemeral?" 
"Geographies," said geographer, "are books which, all books, are most concerned with 
matters consequence. They never become old fashioned. It very rarely a mountain 
changes its position. It very rarely an ocean empties itself its waters. We write eternal 
things." 
"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again," little prince interrupted. 
"What does mean ephemeral?" 
"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to same thing for us," said geographer. 
"The thing matters to us mountain. It does not change." 
"But what does mean ephemeral?" repeated little prince, who never in his life had let go 
of a question, once had asked it. 
"It means, which in danger speedy disappearance. " 
"Is my flower in danger speedy disappearance?" 
"Certainly it is." 
"My flower ephemeral," little prince said to himself, "and she has only four thorns to 
defend herself against world. I have left her on my planet, all alone!" 
That was his first moment regret. But took courage once more. "What place would 
advise me to visit now?" asked. "The planet Earth," replied geographer. "It has a good 
reputation." little prince went away, thinking his flower. 
So then seventh planet was Earth. 
The Earth not just an ordinary planet! 
One can count, there 111 kings not forgetting, to be sure, Negro kings among them, 7000 
geographers, 900000 businessmen, 7500000 tipplers, 311000000 conceited men, to say, 
about 2000000000 grown ups. 
To give an idea size Earth, I will tell before invention electricity it 
was necessary to maintain, over whole six continents, a veritable army 462511 
lamplighters for street lamps. Seen from a slight distance, would make a splendid 
spectacle. 
The movements this army would be regulated like those ballet in opera. First would 
come turn lamplighters New Zealand Australia. Having set their lamps alight, 
these would go off to sleep. Next, lamplighters China Siberia would enter for their steps 
in dance, then they too would be waved back into wings. After would come 
turn lamplighters Russia Indies; then those Africa Europe, then those 
South America; then those North America. never would they make a mistake in order 
of their entry upon stage. It would be magnificent. 
Only man who was in charge single lamp at North Pole, his colleague who was 
responsible for single lamp at South Pole, only these two would live free from toil 
care: they would be busy twice a year. 
When one wishes to play wit, sometimes wanders a little from truth. 
I have not been altogether honest in what I have told about lamplighters. I realise 
that I run risk giving a false idea our planet to those who do not know it. 
Men occupy a very small place upon Earth. If two billion inhabitants who people its 
surface were all to stand upright somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public 
assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long twenty miles wide. 
All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet. 
The grown ups, to be sure, will not believe when tell them that. They imagine they fill 
a great deal space. They fancy themselves as important as baobabs. should advise 
them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, will please them. But do 
not waste your time on this extra task. It unnecessary. have, I know, confidence in me. 
When little prince arrived on Earth, was very much surprised not to see any people. 
was beginning to be afraid had come to wrong planet, when a coil gold, colour 
moonlight, flashed across sand. 
"Good evening," said little prince courteously. 
"Good evening," said snake. 
"What planet this on which I have come down?" asked little prince. 
"This Earth; this Africa," snake answered. 
"Ah! Then there are no people on Earth?" 
"This desert. There are no people in desert. Earth large," said snake. 
The little prince sat down on a stone, raised his eyes toward sky. 
"I wonder," said, "whether stars are set alight in heaven so one day each one us 
may find his own again... Look at my planet. It right there above us. But how far away it is!" 
"It beautiful," snake said. "What has brought here?" 
"I have been having some trouble with a flower," said little prince. "Ah!" said snake. 
they were both silent. 
"Where are men?" little prince at last took up conversation again. "It a little lonely 
in desert..." 
"It also lonely among men," snake said. little prince gazed at him for a long time. 
"You are a funny animal," said at last. "You are no thicker than a finger..." 
"But I am more powerful than finger a king," said snake. 
The little prince smiled. "You are not very powerful. havent even any feet. cannot even 
travel..." 
"I can carry farther than any ship could take you," said snake. twined himself around 
the little princes ankle, like a golden bracelet. 
"Whomever I touch, I send back to earth from whence came," snake spoke again. "But 
you are innocent true, come from a star..." 
The little prince made no reply. "You move me to pity, are so weak on this Earth made 
granite," snake said. "I can help you, some day, if grow too homesick for your own planet. 
I can..." 
"Oh! I understand very well," said little prince. "But why do always speak in 
riddles?" 
"I solve them all," said snake. they were both silent. 
The little prince crossed desert met with only one flower. 
It was a flower with three petals, a flower no account at all. 
"Good morning," said little prince. 
"Good morning," said flower. 
"Where are men?" little prince asked, politely. flower had once seen a caravan 
passing. 
"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven them in existence. I saw them, several 
years ago. But one never knows where to find them. wind blows them away. They have no 
roots, makes their life very difficult." 
"Goodbye," said little prince. 
"Goodbye," said flower. 
After that, little prince climbed a high mountain. only mountains had ever known were 
the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. used extinct volcano as a footstool. 
"From a mountain as high as this one," said to himself, "I shall be able to see whole planet 
at one glance, all people..." But saw nothing, save peaks rock were sharpened 
like needles. 
"Good morning," said courteously. 
"Good morning... Good morning... Good morning," answered echo. 
"Who are you?" said little prince. 
"Who are you... Who are you... Who are you?" answered echo. 
"Be my friends. I am all alone," said. 
"I am all alone... all alone. ..all alone," answered echo. 
"What a queer planet!" thought. "It altogether dry, altogether pointed, altogether 
harsh forbidding. people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to 
them... On my planet I had a flower; she always was first to speak..." 
But it happened after walking for a long time through sand, rocks, snow, little 
prince at last came upon a road. all roads lead to abodes men. 
"Good morning," said. was standing before a garden, all a bloom with roses. 
"Good morning," said roses. 
The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower. 
"Who are you?" demanded, thunderstruck. 
"We are roses," roses said. was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him 
she was only one her kind in all universe. here were five thousand them, all 
alike, in one single garden! 
"She would be very much annoyed," said to himself, "if she should see that... she would cough 
most dreadfully, she would pretend she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. I 
should be obliged to pretend I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble 
myself also, she would really allow herself to die..." 
Then went on with his reflections: "I thought I was rich, with a flower was unique in all 
the world; all I had was a common rose. A common rose, three volcanoes come up to 
my knees — one them perhaps extinct forever... doesnt make me a very great 
prince..." lay down in grass cried. 
It was then fox appeared. 
"Good morning," said fox. 
"Good morning," little prince responded politely, although when turned around saw 
nothing. 
"I am right here," voice said, "under apple tree." " 
Who are you?" asked little prince, added, "You are very pretty to look at." 
"I am a fox," said fox. 
"Come play with me," proposed little prince. 
"I am so unhappy." "I cannot play with you," fox said. "I am not tamed." 
"Ah! Please excuse me," said little prince. But, after some thought, added: "What does 
that mean, tame?" 
"You do not live here," said fox. "What it are looking for?" 
"I am looking for men," said little prince. "What does mean, tame?" 
"Men," said fox. "They have guns, they hunt. It very disturbing. They also raise 
chickens. These are their only interests. Are looking for chickens?" 
"No," said little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does mean, tame?" 
"It an act too often neglected," said fox. It means to establish ties." 
"To establish ties?" 
"Just that," said fox. "To me, are still nothing more than a little boy who just like a 
hundred thousand other little boys. I have no need you. you, on your part, have no 
need me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if 
tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, will be unique in all world. To you, I shall 
be unique in all world..." 
"I am beginning to understand," said little prince. "There a flower... I think she has 
tamed me..." 
"It possible," said fox. "On Earth one sees all sorts things." 
"Oh, but this not on Earth!" said little prince. fox seemed perplexed, very 
curious. 
"On another planet?" 
"Yes." 
"Are there hunters on this planet?" 
"No." 
"Ah, interesting! Are there chickens?" 
"No." 
"Nothing perfect," sighed fox. But came back to his idea. "My life very monotonous," 
the fox said. "I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All chickens are just alike, all men are 
just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if tame me, it will be as if sun 
came to shine on my life. I shall know sound a step will be different from all others. 
Other steps send me hurrying back underneath ground. Yours will call me, like music, out 
my burrow. then look: see grain fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat 
no use to me. wheat fields have nothing to say to me. sad. But have hair 
is colour gold. Think how wonderful will be when have tamed me! grain, which 
is also golden, will bring me back thought you. I shall love to listen to wind in 
wheat..." fox gazed at little prince, for a long time. "Please, tame me!" said. 
"I want to, very much," little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to 
discover, a great many things to understand." 
"One only understands things one tames," said fox. "Men have no more time to 
understand anything. They buy things all ready made at shops. But there no shop anywhere 
where one can buy friendship, so men have no friends any more. If want a friend, tame 
me..." 
"What must I do, to tame you?" asked little prince. 
"You must be very patient," replied fox. "First will sit down at a little distance from me, 
like that, in grass. I shall look at out corner my eye, will say nothing. 
Words are source misunderstandings. But will sit a little closer to me, every day..." 
The next day little prince came back. 
"It would have been better to come back at same hour," said fox. "If, for example, 
come at four oclock in afternoon, then at three oclock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel 
happier happier as hour advances. At four oclock, I shall already be worrying 
jumping about. I shall show how happy I am! But if come at just any time, I shall never 
know at what hour my heart to be ready to greet you... One must observe proper rites..." 
"What a rite?" asked little prince. 
"Those also are actions too often neglected," said fox. "They are what make one day 
different from other days, one hour from other hours. There a rite, for example, among my 
hunters. Every Thursday they dance with village girls. So Thursday a wonderful day for me! 
I can take a walk as far as vineyards. But if hunters danced at just any time, every day 
would be like every other day, I should never have any vacation at all." 
So little prince tamed fox. when hour his departure drew near... 
"Ah," said fox, "I shall cry." 
"It your own fault," said little prince. "I never wished any sort harm; but wanted 
me to tame you..." 
"Yes, so," said fox. 
"But now are going to cry!" said little prince. 
"Yes, so," said fox. 
"Then it has done no good at all!" 
"It has done me good," said fox, "because colour wheat fields." then 
added: "Go look again at roses. will understand now yours unique in all 
world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, I will make a present a secret." 
The little prince went away, to look again at roses. "You are not at all like my rose," said. 
"As yet are nothing. No one has tamed you, have tamed no one. are like my fox 
when I first knew him. was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made 
him my friend, now unique in all world." roses were very much embarrassed. 
"You are beautiful, but are empty," went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an 
ordinary passer by would think my rose looked just like you, rose belongs to me. But 
in herself alone she more important than all hundreds other roses: because it she 
that I have watered; because it she I have put under glass globe; because it she 
I have sheltered behind screen; because it for her I have killed caterpillars except 
the two or three we saved to become butterflies; because it she I have listened to, 
when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she my 
rose. 
And went back to meet fox. "Goodbye," said. 
"Goodbye," said fox. "And now here my secret, a very simple secret: It only with 
heart one can see rightly; what essential invisible to eye." 
"What essential invisible to eye," little prince repeated, so would be sure to 
remember. 
"Are they pursuing first travellers?" demanded little prince. 
"They are pursuing nothing at all," said switchman. "They are asleep in there, or if they are 
not asleep they are yawning. Only children are flattening their noses against 
windowpanes." 
"Only children know what they are looking for," said little prince. 
"They waste their time over a rag doll it becomes very important to them; if anybody 
takes it away from them, they cry..." "They are lucky," switchman said. 
"Good morning," said little prince. 
"Good morning," said merchant. 
This was a merchant who sold pills had been invented to quench thirst. need only swallow 
one pill a week, would feel no need anything to drink. 
"Why are selling those?" asked little prince. 
"Because they save a tremendous amount time," said merchant. "Computations have been 
made by experts. With these pills, save fifty three minutes in every week." 
"And what do I do with those fifty three minutes?" 
"Anything like..." 
"As for me," said little prince to himself, "if I had fifty three minutes to spend as I liked, I 
should walk at my leisure toward a spring fresh water." 
It was now eighth day since I had had my accident in desert, I had listened to story 
of merchant as I was drinking last drop my water supply. 
"Ah," I said to little prince, "these memories yours are very charming; but I have not yet 
succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; I, too, should be very happy if 
I could walk at my leisure toward a spring fresh water!" 
"My friend fox..." little prince said to me. 
"My dear little man, this no longer a matter has anything to do with fox!" 
"Why not?" 
"Because I am about to die thirst..." 
He did not follow my reasoning, answered me: "It a good thing to have had a friend, 
even if one about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend..." 
"He has no way guessing danger," I said to myself. "He has never been either hungry or 
thirsty. A little sunshine all needs..." 
But looked at me steadily, replied to my thought: "I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a 
well..." I made a gesture weariness. It absurd to look for a well, at random, in immensity 
of desert. But nevertheless we started walking. 
When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, darkness fell, stars began to 
come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, I looked at them as if I were in a dream. 
little princes last words came reeling back into my memory: "Then are thirsty, too?" I 
demanded. But did not reply to my question. merely said to me: "Water may also be good 
for heart..." 
I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well it was impossible to 
cross examine him. was tired. sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, 
he spoke again: "The stars are beautiful, because a flower cannot be seen." 
I replied, "Yes, so." And, without saying anything more, I looked across ridges sand 
that were stretched out before us in moonlight. 
"The desert beautiful," little prince added. 
And was true. I have always loved desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees 
nothing, hears nothing. Yet through silence something throbs, gleams... 
"What makes desert beautiful," said little prince, "is somewhere it hides a well..." 
I was astonished by a sudden understanding mysterious radiation sands. When I was 
a little boy I lived in an old house, legend told us a treasure was buried there. To be sure, 
no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an 
enchantment over house. My home was hiding a secret in depths its heart... "Yes," I 
said to little prince. "The house, stars, desert — what gives them their beauty 
something invisible!" 
"I am glad," said, "that agree with my fox." As little prince dropped off to sleep, I took 
him in my arms set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, stirred. It seemed to me 
that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, there was nothing more 
fragile on all Earth. In moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks 
hair trembled in wind, I said to myself: 
"What I see here nothing but a shell. What most important invisible..." 
As his lips opened slightly with suspicious a half smile, I said to myself, again: "What 
moves me so deeply, about this little prince who sleeping here, his loyalty to a flower — 
image a rose shines through his whole being like flame a lamp, even when 
asleep..." 
And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt need protecting him, as if himself were a 
flame might be extinguished by a little puff wind... And, as I walked on so, I found well, 
at daybreak. 
"Men," said little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what 
they are looking for. Then they rush about, get excited, turn round round..." 
added: "It not worth trouble..." 
The well we had come to was not like wells Sahara. wells Sahara are 
mere holes dug in sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, 
and I thought I must be dreaming... 
"It strange," I said to little prince. "Everything ready for use: pulley, bucket, 
rope..." laughed, touched rope, set pulley to working. pulley moaned, like 
an old weathervane, which wind has long since forgotten. 
"Do hear?" said little prince. "We have wakened well, it singing..." 
I did not want him to tire himself with rope. 
"Leave it to me," I said. "It too heavy for you." I hoisted bucket slowly to edge 
well set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. song pulley was still 
in my ears, I could see sunlight shimmer in still trembling water. 
"I am thirsty for this water," said little prince. "Give me some it to drink..." 
And I understood what had been looking for. I raised bucket to his lips. drank, his eyes 
closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from 
ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born walk under stars, song pulley, 
the effort my arms. It was good for heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, lights 
of Christmas tree, music Midnight Mass, tenderness smiling faces, used to 
make up, so, radiance gifts I received. 
"The men where live," said little prince, "raise five thousand roses in same garden 
and they do not find in it what they are looking for." 
"They do not find it," I replied. 
"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water." 
"Yes, true," I said. 
And little prince added: "But eyes are blind. One must look with heart..." 
I had drunk water. I breathed easily. At sunrise sand colour honey. 
honey colour was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense grief? 
"You must keep your promise," said little prince, softly, as sat down beside me once more. 
"What promise?" "You know, a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..." 
I took my rough drafts drawings out my pocket. little prince looked them over, 
laughed as said: 
"Your baobabs, they look a little like cabbages." 
"Oh!" I had been so proud my baobabs! "Your fox, his ears look a little like horns; they are 
too long." laughed again. 
"You are not fair, little prince," I said. "I dont know how to draw anything except boa constrictors 
from outside boa constrictors from inside." 
"Oh, will be all right," said, "children understand." 
So then I made a pencil sketch a muzzle. as I gave it to him my heart was torn. 
"You have plans I do not know about," I said. But did not answer me. said to me, 
instead: "You know, my descent to earth... Tomorrow will be its anniversary." Then, after a 
silence, went on: "I came down very near here." flushed. 
And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense sorrow. One question, 
however, occurred to me: "Then it was not by chance on morning when I first met — a 
week ago — were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited 
region? were on your way back to place where landed?" 
The little prince flushed again. I added, with some hesitancy: "Perhaps it was because 
anniversary?" little prince flushed once more. never answered questions, but when one 
flushes does not mean "Yes"? 
"Ah," I said to him, "I am a little frightened..." 
But interrupted me. "Now must work. must return to your engine. I will be waiting for 
you here. Come back tomorrow evening..." 
But I was not reassured. I remembered fox. One runs risk weeping a little, if one lets 
himself be tamed... 
Beside well there was ruin an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, next 
evening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top a wall, with his feet 
dangling. I heard him say: "Then dont remember. This not exact spot." Another 
voice must have answered him, for replied to it: "Yes, yes! It right day, but this not 
place." 
I continued my walk toward wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. little prince, 
however, replied once again: "...Exactly. will see where my track begins, in sand. have 
nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight." 
I was only twenty metres from wall, I still saw nothing. After a silence little prince 
spoke again: "You have good poison? are sure it will not make me suffer too long?" I 
stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand. "Now go away," said 
the little prince. "I want to get down from wall." 
I dropped my eyes, then, to foot wall... I leaped into air. There before me, facing 
the little prince, was one those yellow snakes take just thirty seconds to bring your life to 
an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. 
But, at noise I made, snake let himself flow easily across sand like dying spray 
a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among stones. I 
reached wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow. 
"What does this mean?" I demanded. "Why are talking with snakes?" 
I had loosened golden muffler always wore. I had moistened his temples, had 
given him some water to drink. now I did not dare ask him any more questions. looked at 
me very gravely, put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like heart a 
dying bird, shot with someones rifle... 
"I am glad have found what was matter with your engine," said. "Now can go 
back home" 
"How do know about that?" I was just coming to tell him my work had been successful, 
beyond anything I had dared to hope. 
He made no answer to my question, but added: "I, too, am going back home today..." Then, 
sadly, "It much farther... it much more difficult..." I realised clearly something 
extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if were a little child; 
yet it seemed to me was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing 
to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away. 
"I have your sheep. I have sheeps box. I have muzzle..." 
And gave me a sad smile. I waited a long time. I could see was reviving little by little. 
"Dear little man," I said to him, "you are afraid..." was afraid, there was no doubt about that. 
But laughed lightly. 
"I shall be much more afraid this evening..." 
Once again I felt myself frozen by sense something irreparable. I knew I could not 
bear thought never hearing laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring fresh 
water in desert. 
"Little man," I said, "I want to hear laugh again." But said to me: "Tonight, it will be a 
year... my star, then, can be found right above place where I came to Earth, a year ago..." 
"Little man," I said, "tell me it only a bad dream, this affair snake, meeting
place, star..." But did not answer my plea. 
He said to me, instead: "The thing important thing not seen..." "Yes, I 
know..." 
"It just as it with flower. If love a flower lives on a star, it sweet to look at 
sky at night. All stars are a bloom with flowers..." 
"Yes, I know..." 
"It just as it with water. Because pulley, rope, what gave me to drink 
was like music. remember, how good it was." 
"Yes, I know..." 
"And at night will look up at stars. Where I live everything so small I cannot show 
you where my star to be found. It better, like that. My star will just be one stars, for 
you. so will love to watch all stars in heavens... they will all be your friends. And, 
besides, I am going to make a present..." laughed again. 
"Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear laughter!" 
"That my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank water..." 
"What are trying to say?" 
"All men have stars," answered, "but they are not same things for different people. For 
some, who are travellers, stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in 
sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But 
all these stars are silent. You, alone, will have stars as no one else has them" 
"What are trying to say?" 
"In one stars I shall be living. In one them I shall be laughing. so it will be as if all 
the stars were laughing, when look at sky at night... you, only you, will have stars can 
laugh!" 
And laughed again. "And when your sorrow comforted time soothes all sorrows will be 
content have known me. will always be my friend. will want to laugh with me. 
you will sometimes open your window, so, for pleasure... your friends will be properly 
astonished to see laughing as look up at sky! Then will say to them, Yes, 
stars always make me laugh! they will think are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick 
"I shall not leave you." 
But a thought came to reassure him: "It true they have no more poison for a second bite." 
That night I did not see him set out on his way. got away from me without making a sound. 
When I succeeded in catching up with him was walking along with a quick resolute step. 
said to me merely: "Ah! are there..." took me by hand. But was still worrying. 
"It was wrong to come. will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; will not be 
true..." 
I said nothing. 
"You understand... it too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It too heavy." 
I said nothing. 
"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There nothing sad about old shells..." 
I said nothing. was a little discouraged. But made one more effort: "You know, it will be 
very nice. I, too, shall look at stars. All stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All stars 
will pour out fresh water for me to drink..." 
I said nothing. 
"That will be so amusing! will have five hundred million little bells, I shall have five 
hundred million springs fresh water..." too said nothing more, because was crying... 
"Here it is. Let me go on by myself." sat down, because was afraid. Then said, 
again: "You know, my flower... I am responsible for her. she so weak! She has four thorns, 
of no use at all, to protect herself against all world..." 
I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer. "There now, all..." 
He still hesitated a little; then got up. took one step. I could not move. There was nothing 
but a flash yellow close to his ankle. remained motionless for an instant. did not cry out. 
He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because sand. 
And now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. 
The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told 
them: "I am tired." Now my sorrow comforted a little. to say, not entirely. But I know 
that did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a 
heavy body... at night I love to listen to stars. It like five hundred million little bells... 
But there one extraordinary thing... when I drew muzzle for little prince, I forgot to add 
the leather strap to it. will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. 
So now I keep wondering: what happening on his planet? Perhaps sheep has eaten 
flower... At one time I say to myself: "Surely not! little prince shuts his flower under her glass 
globe every night, watches over his sheep very carefully..." Then I am happy. there 
sweetness in laughter all stars. 
But at another time I say to myself: "At some moment or other one absent minded, 
enough! On some one evening forgot glass globe, or sheep got out, without making any 
noise, in night..."
